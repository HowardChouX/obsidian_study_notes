By being open-minded and proactive, I can adapt to the new environment more smoothly.

Yes, I think small talks are very useful. They help to break the ice and build a friendly relationship with colleagues or clients. For example, talking about the weather or weekend plans can make conversations more relaxed and comfortable. This can lead to better teamwork and cooperation. However, it is important to know the right time and topic for small talk, so it does not disturb work or make others feel uncomfortable.

**1. On the rising trend of young people depending on takeout daily for three meals, briefly state if you support it and explain with specific reasons.**
I do not support depending on takeout for all meals. My first reason is health. Takeout food is often high in oil, salt, and sugar, which is not good for our body if eaten every day. Second, it is expensive. Ordering food daily costs much more money than cooking at home. Finally, it creates a lot of plastic waste from packaging, which is bad for the environment. For these health, economic, and environmental reasons, I believe we should reduce our reliance on takeout.

**2. Please briefly describe the impact of intelligent robots on human life.**
Intelligent robots have both positive and negative impacts on our lives. On the positive side, they can do dangerous or repetitive jobs, like in factories, which makes work safer for humans. They also help in homes, for example, as cleaning robots. However, there are concerns. Some people worry that robots will take away too many jobs from humans. Also, if we rely too much on robots, we might lose some of our own skills. Overall, robots are useful tools, but we need to use them wisely.

**3. Describe specific ways your family influenced your self-growth, and support your description with a real-life example.**
My family has influenced my growth mainly by teaching me the value of hard work and persistence. For example, when I was preparing for a difficult programming competition in high school, I felt like giving up many times. My parents didn't solve the problems for me, but they encouraged me to keep trying and to break the big task into smaller steps. This experience taught me that success comes from continuous effort, not just talent. It's a lesson I apply to all challenges in my university studies now.

**4. How does social connection, like getting along with roommates and staying in touch with friends, help college students keep mentally healthy?**
Social connections are very important for mental health in college. When students get along well with roommates, they have a supportive environment at home, which reduces stress. Staying in touch with old friends provides emotional support and a sense of belonging, especially when feeling homesick. Talking about problems with friends can also offer new perspectives and solutions. In short, these connections make students feel understood, supported, and less alone, which is key to maintaining good mental health.

**5. What are some tips for maintaining good mental health in college?**
Here are a few practical tips. First, manage your time well. Make a schedule to balance study, rest, and fun activities to avoid feeling too stressed. Second, exercise regularly. Physical activity, like running or playing sports, is a great way to reduce anxiety and improve mood. Third, don't be afraid to ask for help. Talk to friends, family, or university counselors if you feel overwhelmed. Taking care of your mind is just as important as taking care of your studies.

**6. Express your opinion on whether you approve of college students keeping pets in or outside their dormitories. Why?**
I do not approve of keeping pets inside dormitories. Dorm rooms are usually small and shared spaces, which is not a suitable or fair environment for an animal. Pets need more space, regular care, and can disturb roommates who may have allergies or different habits. However, I think it could be acceptable for students to keep pets outside, like in a family home, if they can ensure the pet's well-being without affecting their studies or campus life.

**7. Beyond natural talents, what other factors contribute to the success of high-level athletes in sports competition?**
Beyond natural talent, hard work and mental strength are key to an athlete's success. First, they must train for countless hours to improve their skills and physical condition. Second, they need strong mental power to handle pressure, stay focused during competitions, and recover from losses. Third, having a good support system, like coaches, family, and teammates, provides necessary guidance and encouragement. Success in sports is the result of long-term dedication, not just innate ability.

**8. What is your view on academic plagiarism on campus (e.g., copying papers, paraphrasing without citation, or using others’ homework as one’s own)?**
I have a very negative view of academic plagiarism. It is a serious form of cheating. First, it is unfair to students who do their own work honestly. Second, it defeats the purpose of education, which is to learn and develop one's own thinking skills. If students plagiarize, they miss the chance to truly understand the subject. Universities should teach proper citation and punish plagiarism strictly to protect the value of academic work and ensure all students have a fair learning environment.
