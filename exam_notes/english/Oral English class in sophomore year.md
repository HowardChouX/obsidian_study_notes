**1. On the rising trend of young people depending on takeout daily for three meals, briefly state if you support it and explain with specific reasons.**
I do not support depending on takeout for all meals. My first reason is health. Takeout food is often high in oil, salt, and sugar, which is not good for our body if eaten every day. Second, it is expensive. Ordering food daily costs much more money than cooking at home. Finally, it creates a lot of plastic waste from packaging, which is bad for the environment. For these health, economic, and environmental reasons, I believe we should reduce our reliance on takeout.

**2. Please briefly describe the impact of intelligent robots on human life.**
Intelligent robots have both positive and negative impacts on our lives. On the positive side, they can do dangerous or repetitive jobs, like in factories, which makes work safer for humans. They also help in homes, for example, as cleaning robots. However, there are concerns. Some people worry that robots will take away too many jobs from humans. Also, if we rely too much on robots, we might lose some of our own skills. Overall, robots are useful tools, but we need to use them wisely.

**3. Describe specific ways your family influenced your self-growth, and support your description with a real-life example.**
My family has influenced my growth mainly by teaching me the value of hard work and persistence. For example, when I was preparing for a difficult programming competition in high school, I felt like giving up many times. My parents didn't solve the problems for me, but they encouraged me to keep trying and to break the big task into smaller steps. This experience taught me that success comes from continuous effort, not just talent. It's a lesson I apply to all challenges in my university studies now.
描述你的家庭影响你自我成长的具体方式，并用一个现实生活中的例子来支持你的描述。
我的家庭主要通过教导我努力工作和坚持的价值来影响我的成长。例如，当我在高中准备一场困难的编程竞赛时，我多次想要放弃。我的父母没有为我解决问题，但他们鼓励我继续尝试，并把大任务分解成小步骤。这段经历教会我，成功来自于持续的努力，而不仅仅是天赋。这是我现在在大学学习中应对所有挑战时都会运用的一课。

**4. How does social connection, like getting along with roommates and staying in touch with friends, help college students keep mentally healthy?**
Social connections are very important for mental health in college. When students get along well with roommates, they have a supportive environment at home, which reduces stress. Staying in touch with old friends provides emotional support and a sense of belonging, especially when feeling homesick. Talking about problems with friends can also offer new perspectives and solutions. In short, these connections make students feel understood, supported, and less alone, which is key to maintaining good mental health.

**5. What are some tips for maintaining good mental health in college?**

Talk to friends, family, or university counselors if you feel overwhelmed. Taking care of your mind is just as important as taking care of your studies.

**6. Express your opinion on whether you approve of college students keeping pets in or outside their dormitories. Why?**
I do not approve of keeping pets inside dormitories. Dorm rooms are usually small and shared spaces, which is not a suitable or fair environment for an animal. Pets need more space, regular care, and can disturb roommates who may have allergies or different habits. However, I think it could be acceptable for students to keep pets outside, like in a family home, if they can ensure the pet's well-being without affecting their studies or campus life.
请表达你对大学生在宿舍内或宿舍外养宠物的看法。为什么？
我不赞成在宿舍内养宠物。宿舍房间通常很小而且是共享空间，这对动物来说不是一个合适或公平的环境。宠物需要更多空间、定期照料，并且可能会打扰可能有过敏症或不同习惯的室友。然而，我认为如果学生能确保宠物的健康，同时不影响他们的学业或校园生活，那么在宿舍外（比如在家庭住所）养宠物是可以接受的。

**7. Beyond natural talents, what other factors contribute to the success of high-level athletes in sports competition?**
Beyond natural talent, hard work and mental strength are key to an athlete's success. First, they must train for countless hours to improve their skills and physical condition. Second, they need strong mental power to handle pressure, stay focused during competitions, and recover from losses. Third, having a good support system, like coaches, family, and teammates, provides necessary guidance and encouragement. Success in sports is the result of long-term dedication, not just innate ability.
除了天赋，还有哪些因素有助于高水平运动员在体育比赛中取得成功？

**8. What is your view on academic plagiarism on campus (e.g., copying papers, paraphrasing without citation, or using others’ homework as one’s own)?**
I have a very negative view of academic plagiarism. It is a serious form of cheating. First, it is unfair to students who do their own work honestly. Second, it defeats the purpose of education, which is to learn and develop one's own thinking skills. If students plagiarize, they miss the chance to truly understand the subject. Universities should teach proper citation and punish plagiarism strictly to protect the value of academic work and ensure all students have a fair learning environment.
你对校园学术剽窃（例如，抄袭论文、不注明出处地改写、或将他人作业当作自己的）有何看法？
我对学术剽窃持非常负面的看法。这是一种严重的作弊形式。首先，这对诚实完成自己作业的学生不公平。第二，它违背了教育的目的，即学习和培养自己的思维能力。如果学生剽窃，他们就错过了真正理解学科的机会。大学应该教授正确的引用方法，并严格惩罚剽窃行为，以保护学术工作的价值，并确保所有学生都有一个公平的学习环境。
